## Introduction

In my opinion, I think the reason why people don't like playing foreign games is because they don't understand anything, or it takes lots of effort to translate stuff.
But I've been using Google Lens on PC when I play foreign games such as play twRO or Chinese MapleStory, and it's been great so far.

## Tutorial

1. Navigate to [Google Lens](https://lens.google.com/search?p=a).
2. Press Windows + Shift + S to bring up snipping tool and make sure you select the first option.
3. Drag Left-click to select the part where you want to translate.
4. Press Ctrl + V on Google Lens.
5. Click "Translate" option.

## Issues

1. It doesn't work sometimes on Red or Green text.
