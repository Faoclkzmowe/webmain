## Introduction

I'm originally a THRO player that moved to twRO in early 2024. Keep in mind that I'm a F2P player.

## Reason

When I was still in THRO, I enjoyed it a lot because it's the most populated RO server. I always have full party since level 30 to 185,
which is one of a kind. But I had to move was because of Zeny farming is too rough.
I didn't have or find a good source of income, I couldn't access to certain cards and stuff.
Eventually, felt unmotivated to farm Zeny to achieve what I wanted to have, because it's too much.

In twRO, I found a decent lazy Zeny making method, which was one of very few reason I prefered it here. The population wasn't that bad either,
definitely lower than THRO without a doubt though.

## Population

There are 4 seperated server, but the most populated one is called "波利", which is pretty active as player count is around 5K-8K depends on the time.
Party Leveling is also alive mostly since level 85 onwards.

Here are some twRO leveling gameplay, keep in mind that I could find a party as early as level 84, and it will get easier the higher the level I am.

## Bot

Yes, a lot of bots at certain areas such as Magma F2, Thanatos Tower F12, EP19 area. It's actually infuriating, because all bots looked and did the same thing,
so it shouldn't be that hard to ban them. Players do report them on the forums though, so hopefully GMs will do something about them actively.

## Economy

I guess we all can agree that every official servers favor P2W, and F2P will suffer one way or another. At the moment, I'm farming Zeny for completed EP19 gears which cost around
200M. I can farm 6M a day through "幻想叢書" which is the map that contains daily instances, and it took me around 30 minutes to be done.
So as a F2P player, I run daily instances for 30 minutes, and earn 6M per day. That's pretty decent, and on top of that, I could do more instances in "幻想叢書" to earn more,
but I'm lazy.

## Version

- Episode 19
- Fourth class jobs skill rebalance (4th) and second high expanded class jobs skills rebalance (3rd) on 260/55 level expansion patch

## Summarize

### Pros

- Enjoyable experience as a F2P
- Healthy population
- Party leveling focused
- Decent economy
- 3rd most updated official server (1st - KRO; 2nd - JRO; 3rd - twRO)
- Cheap Kafra teleport (Original price divided by 10)

### Cons

- Mostly active during prime time
- Bots
- Lag spikes from time to time (Location issue, as I didn't have this problem when I was in Japan)

### Score

Personally, I give 7.5/10, it's been great so far.
