## Introduction

Party is better than Solo in terms of everything. TWRO starts to do party leveling from level 85 onwards, or at level 60 on the weekend because of [Weekend Instance](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Weekend).

As for both joining and recruiting, people always use Chat Room System.

## Time

Prime time to find party is during UTC+8: 5PM - 10PM. But on Sunday, UTC+8: 10AM - 10PM.

## Location

Location of where you can find yourself a party.

## Useful Vocabulary

As you keep playing, you'll eventually remember common words like I do.

<Collapse title="Roles">
<span>打 = Attacker
<br></br>詩打 = Minstrel (Attacker)
<br></br>舞打 = Wanderer (Attacker)
<br></br>集 = Arch Bishop (Support)
<br></br>(有獨唱) = Have Troubadour/Trouvere with Kvasir Sonata (No need to wait for Minstrel and Wanderer.)</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Chat">
<span>安安 = Hello
<br></br>WC一下 = Go toilet, wait a moment. (Should log off during this, if leveling.)
<br></br>謝謝大家 or 3Q = Thank you
<br></br>斷線了 = Internet disconnected
<br></br>密碼是 = What is the password? (For joining Chat Room)</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Equipment-Check">
<span>自重 = No check
<br></br>檢 = Check (Depends on the leader, if they gonna let you in or not.)
<br></br>微檢 = Check for Grace set, but if level is under 150, check for Level 100 Eden Equipment.
<br></br>凱薩檢 = Check for Level 150 Armor called "甲-LT", which is one of the most op armor in TWRO.
<br></br>1-2下 = 1 or 2 hits to kill monster.
<br></br><br></br>They are more, but these are common. Will update later.</span>
</Collapse>

## Joining

From level 60-149, you can always join a party without any problem, but from level 150 onwards, some parties start to check your Equipment.

<Collapse title="Step 1 - Find a party">
<span>Looking for words that specify level range such as 108-123 or 108UP. For an example:
<br></br>神殿 108UP -2打 -集 -詩 -舞 means R>Rachel Sanctuary 108-123, need 2 more attackers; 1 Arch Bishop; 1 Minstrel; 1 Wanderer. Or if it's Equipment-Check party, they will
write it in front.</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Step 2 - Ask to join">
<span>Join the Chat Room then tell your level and role. For an example: 安安 我157打 means "Hello, I'm level 157 attacker.", then they will invite you in general. On some case, they will ask if you have DAIDAI or an Experience book.</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Step 3 - Wait">
<span>At this point, wait until there are lots of players in the party, then check on World Map to see where do they gather, which supposed to be at one of the DAIDAIs. If party is failed, which is rare, they will tell everyone to just leave the party.</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Step 4 - Ready to go">
<span>Join the Chat Room means that you're ready, so the Leader will create a Chat Room with or without a password, if they create with a password, they will tell in Chat, so pay attention.
Once everyone's ready, everyone will leave the Chat Room, turn in DAIDAI's daily quest, and Arch Bishop will use Warp Portal to the destination right away. Grind time is normally 1 hour because it lines up with DAIDAI's buff duration.</span>
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Step 5 - Ready to leave">
<span>After 1 hour has passed, Arch Bishop will use Warp Portal to town, so you don't have to use Butterfly Wing. When get out, make sure you type "3Q" which means "Thank you".</span>
</Collapse>

## Recruiting

I don't recommend to recruit party members yourself because sometimes they say a lot of things and you'll have a hard time communicating with them in real time. I did it once and struggled, but luckily someone in the party could speak English, so they helped me.
