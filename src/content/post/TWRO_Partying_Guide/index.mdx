> This guide is specifically made for TWRO.

## Introduction

Party is better than Solo in terms of everything. TWRO starts to do party leveling from level 85 onwards, or at level 80 on the weekend because of [Weekend Instance](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Weekend).

As for both joining and recruiting, people always use Chat Room System.

## Location

Location of where you can find yourself a party.

## Joining

From level 108-149, you can always join a party without any problem, but from level 150 onwards, some parties start to check your equipments.

### Important words & sentences

## Recruiting

I don't recommend to recruit party members yourself because sometimes they say a lot of things and you'll have a hard time communicating with them in real time.
